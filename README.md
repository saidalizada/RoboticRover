# RoboticRover
A squad of robotic rovers are to be landed by NASA on a plateau on Mars.
This plateau, which is curiously rectangular, must be navigated by
the rovers so that their on-board cameras can get a complete view of the
surrounding terrain to send back to Earth. A roverâ€™s position and location
is represented by a combination of x and y co- ordinates and a letter
representing one of the four cardinal compass points. The plateau is
divided up into a grid to simplify navigation.
